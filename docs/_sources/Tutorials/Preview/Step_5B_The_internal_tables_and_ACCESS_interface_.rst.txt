Step 5B - The internal tables and ACCESS interface
--------------------------------------------------

BRIDG uses the SQLITE3 database format for its database files.
Typically, the database files created by the program are not saved and only
used during the run.  If you wish to review these tables or use them in an
other application, then you need to instruct BRIDG to not delete the database
file on program exit, and tell it to populate the tables with internal values
if you need access to this information as well.

During program operation, the SQLITE3 database files are only used for storage
of the input data and other values that are not access time critical.
Because databases are much to slow to be used during the operation of
the program, the program uses a proprietary internal memory resident
database system that mirrors the database tables in the SQLITE3 file.
The program can be instructed to populate the SQLITE3 database
(i.e. copy the memory data into the database file's tables.) upon demand.
All the values that have been computed up to the time the populate command
is given are copied to the SQLITE3 database.

You do not need a copy of an SQL database viewer, e.g., Microsoft's ACCESS,
to view the SQLITE3 database file.
The `editor` window in the program is a view into that file.
To view the internal tables, turn on the `internal table view` switch as
described below.

To view and save the SQLITE3 database do the following.
The database file name is always ``~bridg##.mdb``, where ``##`` is a number
that is incremented from 01 up until a unique unused file name is found.
The directory is the temporary file directory that is specified in the
options panels illustrated below.  A future option will be to save this file
by the broidge file name and put it in the bridge file's directory.

Remember that only data computed at the time the populate tables command
is given will be written into the tables. Thus, it is often advantageous
to do a complete analysis with the `FEA` tool bar button and then run the
populate tables processor.

First, tell BRIDG to not delete the database file upon exit.
To do this, first open the `Options` dialog by selecting the `View` menu
and then selecting the `Options` menu pick.
The following panel will appear.

In order to view the internal tables set the following switch in the
`Appearance` tab of the options dialog.

Now tell the program to populate the SQLITE3 database tables.
Use the `Diagnostics and File Export` tab in the options dialog.

Step 5C - Finite Element Model export
--------------------------------------------------

During the development of the BRIDG program, a number of other general purpose finite element analysis programs were used for testing.  The program was equipped with a number of file translators that generated input files for these other programs.  It was decided to keep this capability in the program and make it available for general use.</P>

To export the current bridge's finite element model, use the Options tab
`Diagnostics and File Exports` tab that can be found in the Options dialog.
To do this, first open the `Options` dialog by selecting the `View` menu and
then selecting the `Options` menu pick.
Then select the `Diagnostics and File Exports` tab.

The file will be generated in the same directory as the BDF file with the 
appropriate file extension.

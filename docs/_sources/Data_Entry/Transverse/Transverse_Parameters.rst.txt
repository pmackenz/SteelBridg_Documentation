Transverse Parameters
=================================
Example:



.. list-table::
    :widths: 15 10 10 40
    :header-rows: 1
   
    * - Parameter
      - Data
      - Units
      - Description
    * - Dist2Edge
      - Distance
      - Feet
      - Distance from edge of crossbeam to edge of deck. See :ref:`Transverse Theory`
    * - DistShyL
      - Distance 
      - Feet
      - Distance from left edge of deck to edge of first left side lane. See :ref:`Transverse Theory`
    * - DistShyR
      - Distance 
      - Feet
      - Distance from right edge of deck to edge of first right side lane. See :ref:`Transverse Theory`
    * - MultDL
      - Multiplyer 
      - Real number
      - If DL reactions from single lane analysis then multiply for total lanes.      
    * - MultSDL_DC
      - Multiplyer
      - Real number
      - If superimposed DC DL reactions from single lane analysis then multiply for total lanes.      
    * - MultSDL_DW
      - Multiplyer 
      - Real number
      - If superimposed DW DL reactions from single lane analysis then multiply for total lanes.  
    * - MultSecEff
      - Multiplyer
      - Real number
      - The MultSecEff is used for magnifying secondary effect reactions that can be result of a post-stressed concrete beam  analysis.  
    * - REAFile
      - Full path to a REA file. 
      - OS file path
      - see :ref:`Transverse Reactions`  
    * - SlabWidth
      - Distance
      - Feet
      - The full width of the deck including shy distances. See :ref:`Transverse Theory` 
    * - Stiffness
      - code 
      - S:Stiff  F:Flexible
      - Used to determine if the transfer model should use a very stiff or very flexible beam properties. See :ref:`Transverse Theory` 
    * - SupportLoc
      - Value from REA file.
      - Real number
      - Only needed if using REAFile reader. Location of the support to select from the REA file. See :ref:`Transverse Reactions`

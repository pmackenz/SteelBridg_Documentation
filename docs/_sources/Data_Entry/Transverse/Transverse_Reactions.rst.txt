Transverse Reactions
=================================
Example:

- Description
    This table is used for explicit entry of reaction loads to be used with a 2D transverse analysis. The alternate is to use data from an REA file (Please see 2DT Parameters).  Do NOT use both!

- Parameters
    - Type 

      Enter key word:
         DEAD for dead loads.

         SDL for superimposed dead loads. 

         TRUCK for un-factored truck live load.

    - Truck Name 

        If reaction type is TRUCK then this name must correspond to a truck referenced in the 2DTLoadCombDef.

    - Reaction 

        Enter reaction load in kips.  Use  unfactored loads, and for tucks, use the unfactored total truck reaction value including impact.  
        Only use positive reactions.

    - Stage 

        If the load type is DEAD, then enter an option stage for applying the load. If left blank or zero, the last dead load stage will be used.



- The REA File
    
    Whenever a longitudinal analysis is run, a reaction, REA, file is generated. 
    
    You can specify this file name instead of entering data in the reactions table but this is not advised. The better approach is to reference this file once in the 
    parameters table, let the program import the data, then remove the reference, and save the file. This way the one BDF file has all the data needed and not dependant
    on a file REA file that might go walk-about and get lost.

    The reaction locations are taken at the ends of all stringer members in the model. Thus, some entries might have zero reactions if that location is not at a support point.  

    The "Reaction Minimum" column is for information only and not used in the analysis.  Only positive reaction values are used from this file for crossbeam analysis.

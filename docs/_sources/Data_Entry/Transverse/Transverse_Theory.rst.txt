Transverse Theory
=================================


The following diagrams shows how a transverse beam analysis is performed.  
The main feature is an intermediate model that distributes the reaction loads from the deck to the supporting structure.  
This intermediate model's job is to approximate the load distribution effects of the longitudinal structure to the transverse members.

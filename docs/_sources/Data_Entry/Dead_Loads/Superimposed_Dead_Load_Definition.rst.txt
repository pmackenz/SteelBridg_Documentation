Description
----------------

Superimposed dead loads are applied to the final Live Load model. Forces can be applied to member lines and COGO points explicitly.
Use this entry sheet to describe **either** a "Load at Point" **or** a "distributed member load"
applied to a member line.

A full length uniform load can easily be applied by just entering the a Start Value and leaving the End Value, Start Distance, and End Distances blank.</P>

Parameters
-------------

Point Loads
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. rubric:: COGO Point
..

    If this entry is being use to describe a point load, then specify the point where the force will be applied.

.. rubric:: Force Dir
..

    Forces are applied in the **global** coordinate system.
    Note that unlike the member loads, the sense of these loads is consistent with the
    directions of the global coordinate system. Use one of the following six
    direction codes: FX, FY, FZ, MX, My, or MZ. Member loading does not use this entry.

.. rubric:: Force
..

    Enter the force in units of Kips and Feet. Member loading does not use this entry.


Member Loads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. rubric:: COGO Point
..

    For member loading use the key word `MBRLOAD` in this column.

.. rubric:: Mrb Line
..

    Specify which member line to apply this load.</P>

.. rubric:: Load Code
..

    Loads are applied to the major local axis of the member.
    Unless changed by the user, the Y direction is up and the Z direction
    is to the right when looking up station.  For convenience, the Y forces
    are negated so that a positive value will apply downward forces.
    Use the following codes to apply point, linear, and moment forces:

.. rubric:: PY
..

    Magnitude of **Downward** point load.

.. rubric:: PZ
..

    Point Load in  right direction when looking up station.

.. rubric:: LY
..

    Linear **downward** load applied along a member.

.. rubric:: LZ
..

    Linear right direction load applied along a member.

.. rubric:: MY
..

    Moment about the local Y axis. Looking down on the bridge, this load will be in the
    counterclockwise direction.

.. rubric:: MZ
..

    Moment about the local Z axis.

.. rubric:: Start Dist
..

    Distance from start of member line.  Use to specify location of point or moment forces,
    and beginning of linear load.

.. rubric:: End Dist
..

    Distance from start of member line.  Use to specify ending location of linear load.

.. rubric:: Start Value
..

    Point or moment force value, or starting linear load.

.. rubric:: Ending Value
..

    Ending force value for linear load.

.. rubric:: Description
..

    Optional description.

Description
-----------------

This entry is one of the two entries that describe the live load 
forces that are associated with a `Truck`. Truck loads
include these stationary loads in addition to the moving loads 
specified in the :ref:`Truck Definition` entry form. Use the 
same name on this entry as on the :ref: Truck Definition` 
entry to combine stationary loads with moving loads for a single truck definition.
 
Forces can be applied to member lines and COGO points explicitly. Use 
this entry sheet to describe **either**
a "Load at Point" **or** a "distributed member load" applied to a member line.
 
A full length uniform load can easily be applied by just entering the 
a Start Value and leaving the End Value, Start Distance, and End 
Distances blank.


Parameters
---------------

.. rubric:: COGO Point 
..

    If this entry is being use to describe a point load, then specify the 
    point where the force will be applied. Member loading does not use 
    this entry.

.. rubric:: Force Dir 
..

    Forces are applied in the **global**
    coordinate system. Use one of the following six direction codes: FX, 
    FY, FZ, MX, My, or MZ. Note that unlike the member loads, the sense 
    of these loads is consistent with the directions of the global 
    coordinate system. Member loading does not use this entry.

.. rubric:: Force 
..

    Enter the force in units of Kips and Feet. Member loading does not use this entry.

.. rubric:: Mrb Line 
..

    Specify which member line to apply this load.

.. rubric:: Load Code 
..

    Loads are applied to the major local axis of the member. Unless 
    changed by the user, the Y direction is up and the Z direction is to 
    the right when looking up station. For convenience, the Y forces are 
    negated so that a positive value will apply a downward forces. Use 
    the following codes to apply point, linear, and moment forces:

.. rubric:: PY
..

    Magnitude of **downward** point load.

.. rubric:: PZ
..

    Point Load in right direction when looking up station.

.. rubric:: LY
..

    Linear **downward** distributed load applied along a member.

.. rubric:: LZ
..

    Linear right direction distributed load applied along a member.

.. rubric:: MY
..

    Moment about the local Y axis. Looking down on the bridge, this load will be in the counterclockwise direction.

.. rubric:: MZ
..

    Moment about the local Z axis.


.. rubric:: Start Dist 
..

    Distance from start of member line. Use to specify location of point
    or moment forces, and beginning of linear load.

.. rubric:: End Dist 
..

    Distance from start of member line. Use to specify ending location of
    linear load.

.. rubric:: Start Value 
..

    Point or moment force value, or starting linear load.

.. rubric:: Ending Value 
..

    Ending force value for linear load.

.. rubric:: Description 
..

    Optional description.

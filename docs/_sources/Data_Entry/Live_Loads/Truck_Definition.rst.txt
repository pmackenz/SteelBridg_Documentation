Description
------------

The truck definition table defines both trucks and / or lane loading  with moment and shear riders.


Parameters
-----------

.. rubric:: Truck Name
..

    Unique truck name. Use same name here as on the :ref:`Live Load Definition` entry to include stationary forces.

The `Px` and `Dx` parameters defines the truck axle loads and location.  If more than four axles are required,
continue entering more axle loads on the next line.  You need only repeat the truck number on subsequent
lines since the program only reads the uniform loading, lane loading, and title from the first line for any
truck definition.

.. rubric:: P1
..

    Enter axle Load (not required) (Kip)

.. rubric:: D1
..

    Enter spacing to next axle (not required) (Feet)

.. rubric:: P2
..

    Enter axle Load (not required) (Kip)

.. rubric:: D2
..

    Enter spacing to next axle (not required) (Feet)

.. rubric:: P3
..

    Enter axle Load (not required) (Kip)

The `Unif`, `Mom`, and `Shear` entries are only needed on the first line
of a truck definition and are used to specify the alternate lane loading
forces. Enter values in the uniform, moment, and shear fields if an
alternate lane loading is to be compared with the axle/truck loading.
The load resulting in the greatest forces on the bridge will be used.
If you want to keep these results separate from the axle loading condition,
then create two trucks, one with only axle loads, and another with only lane
loads.  Combine the two using the Truck Group and Lane Group entries.

.. rubric:: Unif
..

    Enter alternate lane loading uniform load (not required) (KLF)

.. rubric:: Mom
..

    Enter alternate lane loading moment rider (not required) (Kip)

.. rubric::
..

    Shear Enter alternate lane loading shear rider (not required) (Kip)

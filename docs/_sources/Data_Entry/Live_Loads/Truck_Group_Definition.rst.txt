Description
--------------


The definition of a group of trucks is used in conjunction with a definition
of a group of lanes from :ref:`Lane Group Definition` to describe the
full range of loading that is used to compute a live load envelope.
In the :ref:`Load Combination Definition` both a Lane Group name and a
Truck Group name are referenced.  Refer to the :ref:`Live Load Theory` section of this
manual to understand how these entries are used.

If there are more lanes then trucks, then the last truck in the group is
repeated.  Thus it is very important for overload groups, because the
overload truck must be listed **first** so that it is not repeated.

Note that the order that the trucks are listed in this table is the order that
the trucks will be placed in the corresponding lanes that are listed in the
associated Lane Group.  For a bridge that is transversely symmetric, this is
probably not a concern, but it is up to the engineer to specify enough different
truck groupings to produce the maximum effects.  This specifically refers to
where in a group of trucks the heavier trucks are placed.
Refer to the graphic :ref:`Example of Lane Loading Combinations Using LCR`
and the location of the first truck, the purple one.


Parameters
--------------

.. rubric:: Truck Group Name
..

    Use a unique name for each truck group. Repeat this name for each
    additional lane in the group.

.. rubric:: Truck Name
..

    Reference a "Truck" that specified in either the
    :ref:`Live Load Definition`,
    :ref:`Truck Definition` , or
    :ref:`Live Load Envelope Definition`.`

.. rubric:: Axle Force Multiplier
..

    The values from the envelope data for the referenced "truck" will be
    multiplied by this factor.

.. rubric:: Numerator Denominator Code
..

    All live load envelopes have two parts, a numerator and a denominator part.
    This is required because some forms of the rating equation have live load
    data in both the numerator and denominator.
    Specify in this field which envelope this truck's forces are to be applied.
    Use a **N** for numerator, and a **D** for denominator.

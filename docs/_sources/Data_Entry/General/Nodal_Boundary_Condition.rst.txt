Input Nodal Boundary Condition
=================================
Example:

.. figure:: ../../image/tbNodalBoundaryCond.png
   :alt: image/tbNodalBoundaryCond.png




Parameters
   - CogoPt

      Enter a name of a COGO point to be constrained. The same point can be listed multiple times. See the notes below on multiple point entry.

    - Fx,Fy, and Mz  

      Enter a "Y" in this field to constrain the point in that DOF.

   - Stage 

      Normally a constraint is active in every stage, but this field can be used to specify that a constraint only be active in a single stage. 
      If this entry is used, also use the Reaction Stage entry or else the forces resisted by this constraint will be lost and not re-applied to the model. 
      This might be what is intended but typically not if this feature is used to simulate form-work.

   - Reaction Stage 

      If the Stage feature is used (described above) then specify the stage that the constrained forces are to be re-applied to the model.

   Duplicate Point Entry Note
      If the same Cogo Point is listed multiple times for the same stage, then the resulting boundary condition is the “OR” of all fixity codes. 
      For example, if point AA is listed once with a constraint in the Fx direction, and on another line is listed as having a constraint in the Fy direction, 
      then point AA will be constrained in both the Fx and Fy directions. This makes entry more convenient when point constrains are listed by purpose, 
      not by point number. For example listing all physical supports, then simplification constrains, then model stability constraints.

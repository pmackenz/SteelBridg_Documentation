Span Definition
=================================
Example:

.. figure:: ../../image/tbSpanDef.png
   :alt: image/tbSpanDef.gif

Description
   This table is used to explicitly define the spans. If used you MUST define ALL spans.  
   If this table is empty the program will automatically find spans by looking for nodal boundary conditions.  


Parameters 

   Start  

      The start of a span is defined by specifying the left most line member. (Truss members are invalid for span definition)

   End  

      The end of a span is defined by specifying the right most line member. (Truss members are invalid for span definition)

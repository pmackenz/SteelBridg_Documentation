Staging Definition
=================================
Example:

This is an optional table you can use to document the different dead load stages in the model. 

The program scans all tables that use staging before processing the data to see how many stages are going to be run. 
One technique to investigate the gravity effects of different member groups is to assign their weight to individual stages. 
In the resulting analysis report files the forces for each stage are listed seporately. 
All deadload stage forces are superimposed to create the final effective deadload forces used in the capacity and rating calculations.

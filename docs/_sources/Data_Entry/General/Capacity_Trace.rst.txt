Capacity Trace
==========================

   This help system has the full documentation in flow chart form of how 
   a member's capacity and rating are computed. The terminology
   used in the flow charts is used in the trace report.

   So that you can better validate and understand the results, you can 
   instruct the program to trace all the calculations performed on each 
   member, at each position on the member, and by each factor type. 
   Since the resulting trace file can easily consume an entire hard 
   drive, you control the trace by specifying members and positions in 
   the `CapTrace` table. The parameter `CapTrace` in the `AnalysisControls`
   table must also be "Y" for the trace to occur. The trace is
   performed during the capacity and rating calculations phase so these 
   switches and tables must be set before the analysis is performed.

**DEFINITIONS:**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
   * - Name
     - Enter the member name, or the word ALL for all members.
   * - Distance
     - The distance along the member at a point of interest.
       Review the standard capacity and rating report to find the valid
       distance list per member. An invalid distance will result in no
       trace. Use a negative value, such as -1.0 for all points of interest.
   * - Std
     - Select this column to trace the standard factors analysis.
   * - Inv
     - Select this column to trace the inventory factors analysis.
   * - Opr
     - Select this column to trace the operating factors analysis.

.. note::

    If the Local Buckling length is not entered, then no local buckling length
    check is performed.  A warning is issued that no local buckling length check
    has been done.


* If a member's `TCCode` is `T` then that member will only be checked for tension rating,
and if it is `C` then that member will only be checked for compression rating.

* The `Type` field is informational only, but is used by the viewer when chaining truss members.
  If you select a truss member in the viewer and then select the `Auto Chain` switch,
  then all connecting truss members from the selected one with the same `Type` are
  plotted.  A convenient method for plotting the forces, capacity, rating, etc.
  for an entire top cord or bottom cord of a truss.

* The effective length of a member is it's node to node distance times the effective length factor.  For calculations that involve the major axis of bending, bending about the local Z axis, the effective length factor <span style="font-weight:bold; ">MajEffL</span> is used.  For bending about the minor axis, the local Y axis, the factor <span style="font-weight:bold; ">MinEffL</span> is used.</P>

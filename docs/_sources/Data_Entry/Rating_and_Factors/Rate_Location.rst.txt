**Description**

For line members, it is up to the engineer to specify where the program will
compute a capacity and a rating value.
For non-line members, since their section properties do not change along
their length, every member is checked using the worst case loading and a
single rating per member is generated.  This table is only concerned with
line member locations.

Although it is up to the engineer to identify critical locations, the program
will automatically use the locations along line members per the
`MbrPts` parameter in the  :ref:`Analysis Controls` table.
These automatically generated locations are used in addition to any
explicitly defined locations defined by entries in this table.
The `MbrPts` parameter specifies the number of equal spaced locations along the
length of a member including the two end points.  For example, a `MbrPts` of 5
will create rating locations at the member ends and the three internal third
points.

More then one entry per member line can be specified, and all of the resulting
locations will be used.

    * - Field
      - Descriptions
    * - MbrLine
      - Member line name
    * - StartDist
      - Distance from start of member line to begin scanning
    * - EndDist
      - Distance from start of member line to stop scanning
    * - Num
      - Number of locations to scan between the starting and ending locations
    * - ConstDist
      - Constant distance used instead of Num.
        When a constant distance is specified, the rate locations will be created by marching down the member
        line starting at the Start Dist and continuing at the specified intervals until the End Distance is reached.

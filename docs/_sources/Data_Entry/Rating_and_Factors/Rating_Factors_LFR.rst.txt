Description
------------

Use this table to create a library of factors that are used when
computing the member capacity and rating. Rating factors are applied
on a per member basis, thus the name given for a set of factors on
this table is referenced by the following member entries:

* :ref:`Input Girder Definition`
* :ref:`Input Stringer Definition`
* :ref:`Input Cross Beam_Definition`
* :ref:`Input Floor Beam_Definition`
* :ref:`Input Truss Member`

.. note::

    As a convenience, the name `DEFAULT` all in
    upper case is reserved for all members that have the
    **Factors** field left blank. Thus you only need one entry,
    named DEFAULT, if most or all members are using the same factors, you
    do not need to put any text in their **Factors** field.


Parameters
-----------

There are three sets of factors for Standard (WSDOT),
Inventory, and Operating conditions.

* **Name**

   Unique name for set of factors. See note above about special DEFAULT name.

* **Mode**

   Each set of factors can have up to three lines of data, one for the 
   standard factors, one of inventory factors, and one for operating 
   factors. The same set name is repeated for each of the three lines.

* **Ultimate Load Factors**

    .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 70
      :header-rows: 0

      * - Dead Load
        - Ultimate Dead Load Factor
      * - SI-Dead Load
        - Ultimate Superimposed Dead Load Factor
      * - Pre-Stress
        - Ultimate Prestress Secondary Load Factor
      * - Live Load (N)
        - Ultimate Live Load factor for trucks used in numerator part of rating equation
      * - Live Load (D)
        - Ultimate Live Load factor for trucks used in denominator part of rating equation
      * - Overload (N)
        - Ultimate Overload Live Load factor for numerator part of rating equation.
      * - Overload (D)
        - Ultimate Overload Live Load factor for denominator part of rating equation.
      * - Impact
        - Impact factor. See notes below.
      * - General Live Load Factor
        - Per AASHTO 1989 Guide Spec. Table 1, a
          factor of 1.07 should be applied to live load forces on line members.
          The factor in the column "General Live Load Multiplier" is  for this purpose.

    -  If Overload switch is selected in
       :ref:`Load Combination Definition`
       table entry, then the Overload values will be used
       instead of the Live Load values.

    -  The entered impact factor is used for all STD live load factoring.
       For INV and OPR, if the member is a line member, the impact factor is
       computed per<A HREF="../../Load_Generation/Impact_Factor_Calculation.html">
       AASHTO specifications</A> as a function of span configuration, and
       load type. If the member is a truss member, then this explicit impact
       factor is used for the inventory and operating ratings.


* **Capacity Adjustment Factors**

  - Tensile Axial Strength Reduction

    This is the :math:`\phi` factor used in the strength ratio equation for
    computation of SR1 and SR2.
    See flow chart <A HREF="../../Theory/Capacity_and_Rating_Theory/Theory_5_3/_SS_5_3_1_Compute_Strength_Ratio_for_Tension_Moment.html">SS-5.3.1</A>

  - Compression Axial Strength Reduction

    This is the :math:`\phi` factor used in the strength ratio equation for
    computation of SR3 and  SR4.
    See flow chart <A HREF="../../Theory/Capacity_and_Rating_Theory/Theory_5_3/_SS_5_3_5_Compute_Strength_Ratio_for_Compression_Moment.html">SS-5.3.5</A>

  - Moment Strength Reduction Factor

    This is the :math:`\phi`  factor used in the moment rating equation for
    line members.
    See flow chart <A HREF="../../Theory/Capacity_and_Rating_Theory/Theory_6_0_6_4/_SS_6_1_1_Compute_Moment_Rating_Factor_for_WSDOT_Inventory_Operating_Level.html">SS-6.1.1</A>

  - Shear Strength Reduction Factor

    This is the :math:`\phi` factor used in the shear rating equation for
    line members.
    See flow chart <A HREF="../../Theory/Capacity_and_Rating_Theory/Theory_6_0_6_4/_SS_6_1_2_Compute_Shear_Rating_Factor_for_WSDOT_Inventory_Operating.html">SS-6.1.2</A>

* **Capacity Reduction Factors**

    - Axial Strength Reduction Factors for tension and compression.
    - Moment Strength Reduction Factor
    - Shear Strength Reduction Factor

Example Entry
----------------

*  Example shows different factors for Redundant Line members,
   NonRedundant line members, and Truss members.
*  Values shown are example only! Factors are for new bridge with no deterioration.
*  A blank cell shown below indicates where a value is not needed or used by the program.
*  STD (WSDOT BDM) specifies a 0.8 factor for non-redundant members.

Reference: WSDOT BDM 14.1.5,14.1.6.1 and 1985 Guide Spec. for
Evaluation of Truss Bridges.

.. note::

    (1) INV and OPR impact factor for line members calculated per
    :ref:`Impact Factor Calculation` AASHTO 3.8.2.

.. note::

   (2) For INV and OPR compute impact factor for truss members using
   equation :math:`1 + (50/(L+125))` limited to maximum of 1.3. Use distance
   between truss supports for L. Enter value in table. For STD truss 
   impact factor, use the same value as the line members.
   See topic page :ref:`Impact Factor Calculation`.


The compression axial strength reduction factors for line members are
only used when a line member requires analysis as a non-line member.
See theory flow charts
<A HREF="../../Theory/Capacity_and_Rating_Theory/Theory_5_2_1/_SS_5_2_1_Negative_Moment_Capacity.html">SS-5.2.1</A>
and
<A HREF="../../Theory/Capacity_and_Rating_Theory/Theory_5_2_2_5_2_3/_SS_5_2_2_Positive_Moment_Capacity.html">SS-5.2.2</A>.
If these entries are left blank, then default valuse of 0.80 for STD
and 0.85 for INV and OPR will be used.

Rebar Definition
-----------------

Rebar entries are referenced in the
<A href="Input_Concrete_Slab_Definition.html">Slab Definition table</A> .
Rebar data is only used for computation of the concrete compression block
for composite member positive moment capacity calculations.
Since only one entry is allowed per slab definition, and not including
the rebar steel is conservative, if your rebar steel varies, entry of a
low average might be appropriate, but dependent on engineering judgment.

    * - Field
      - Description
    * - Name
      - A unique rebar entry name. Only one entry per name.
    * - Long. Dist. From Top
      - For rebar in the longitudinal direction, enter distance in inches from top of slab, not including the crown distance.
    * - Long. Top Steel Area
      - For top rebar in the longitudinal direction , enter area of steel in square inches per square foot of slab.
    * - Long. Dist. From Bottom
      - For rebar in the longitudinal direction, enter distance up in inches from bottom of slab. Bottom of slab is defined as the �Thk� distance.
    * - Long. Bottom Steel Area
      - For bottom rebar in the longitudinal direction , enter area of steel in square inches per square foot of slab.
    * - Tran. Dist. From Top
      - For rebar in the transverse direction, enter distance in inches from top of slab, not including the crown distance.
    * - Tran. Top Steel Area
      - For top rebar in the transverse direction , enter area of steel in square inches per square foot of slab.
    * - Tran. Dist. From Bottom
      - For rebar in the transverse direction, enter distance up in inches from bottom of slab. Bottom of slab is defined as the �Thk� distance.
    * - Tran. Bottom Steel Area
      - For bottom rebar in the transverse direction , enter area of steel in square inches per square foot of slab.

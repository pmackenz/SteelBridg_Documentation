Validation
===========================================

Bridg is using a set of real bridge models to validate results against

* selected hand calculations
* results from other software products
* previous versions of Bridg (like Bridg97 for LFR).

In addition, the validation set is analyzed and compared against
what is considered the correct output with every release update to minimize the risk of new bugs entering the code base with any new patch.

Load Combination Theory
===============================

The envelope data used in a load combination is computed using the dead load
data set collections, and the Truck-Path envelopes.

Terminology
------------------

1. **Forces**

    One Data Set

    :DSC: One Data Set Collection
          = The collection of all data sets for all points of interest in the analysis.
    :DLC: DSC for final effective dead loads
    :SDLC: DSC for superimposed dead loads
    :PSC: DSC for Prestress secondary loads
    :TPE: DSC for each Truck-Path envelope. One truck running on one path (lane).

2. **Factors**

    :AFM:   :ref:`Truck Group Definition`:AFM = Axle Force Multiplier (TruckGroupDef)
    :LLR:   :ref:`Lane Load Reduction Definition`:LLR = Lane Load Reduction (LaneLoadReductionDef)
    :IF:    :ref:`Load Combination Definition`:IF = Impact Factor (LoadCombinationDef)
    :UDLF:  :ref:`Rating Factors for LFR`:UDLF = Ultimate Dead Load Factor (RatingFactors)
    :USDLF: :ref:`Rating Factors for LFR`:USDLF = Ultimate Dead Load Factor (RatingFactors)
    :UPSF:  :ref:`Rating Factors for LFR`:UPSF = Ultimate Prestress Factor (RatingFactors)
    :ULLF:  :ref:`Truck Group Definition`:ULLF = Ultimate Live Load Factor (RatingFactors)

    These factors are not used to factor the forces but included here for reference purposes.

    :MSRF: = Moment Strength Reduction Factor (RatingFactors)
    :SSRF: = Shear Strength Reduction Factor (RatingFactors)
    :ASRF: = Axial Strength Reduction Factor (RatingFactors)

3. **Combinations**

    The forces used when rating a member are created by combining the following
    force data sets with the appropriate factors.

    The term `WCTPE` refers to the worst case live load forces that result when
    scanning all of the possible truck and lane configurations specified by the
    Lane Group and Truck Group combination. For example, all of the truck loading
    configurations shown in the
    :ref:`Example of Lane Loading Combinations Using LCR` would be scanned and
    the most extreme value for the requested force type (Max Moment, Max Shear, etc.)
    would be saved as the `WCTPE`.
    There are in fact two `WCTPE`'s calculated, one for the Numerator and one for
    the Denominator portions of the equations.  Which trucks contribute to which
    is defined in the :ref:`Truck Group definition` table.

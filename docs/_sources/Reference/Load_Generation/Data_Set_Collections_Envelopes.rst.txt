Data Set Collections ( Envelopes )
======================================================

The number of data set collections required is:

    * One for each dead load stage
    * One for the superimposed dead load stage
    * One for each truck in each lane in each lane group used in a load combination.
    * Two for each load combination; one for the numerator and one for the denominator part.

A simple Example
-------------------

Assume:

    * Five member lines that are 200 feet long
    * One hundred truss members
    * One Lane Group with 4 lanes maximum
    * One Truck Group with two different  trucks referenced
    * One Load Combination that uses :ref:`Lane Group Positioning Methods`:`LCR` lane mode.
    * Two dead load stages* No explicit rate locations

Compute number of `DS` per `DSC`:

    :A:  Number of :ref:`Points of Interest`:`POIs` per Line members.
    :B:  Total number of line member `POIs`.
    :C:  Number of `POIs` for truss members.


Compute number of load cases:

.. math::

    (two~deal~load) + (one~superimposed~dead~load) + {} \\

    (8~unfactored~truck~loads,~one~for~each~truck~on~each~possible~path) + {} \\

    (two~for~the~one~load~combination,~denominator~and~numerator~parts) = 13

.. math::

    Total~number~of~DS~collected~for~all~load~cases = 605 * 13 = 7865

Storage requirements ( approximate):

.. math::

    Dead~loads = 40~bytes~per~DS~and~Live~loads = 96~bytes~per~DS \\
    (605 * 40 * 3 ) + ( 605 * 96 * 9) =  595,320 ~bytes.

Introduction to Load Entry Tables
======================================================


There are eleven data tables that are used to define the non gravity
loads on a model.  Read the discussion on load
:ref:`Load Combination Theory` to see how and when the data specified
in the following tables are used.

:ref:`Dead Load Definition`

    Use this table to specify nodal or member loads for any dead load stage.

:ref:`Superimposed Dead Load Definition`

    Use this table to specify nodal or member loads for the superimposed dead load stage.

:ref:`Live Load Definition`

    A `Truck` can have static loads associated with it.
    These can be either nodal or member forces that are applied to the
    model with the moving loads.

:ref:`Truck Definition`

    BRIDG uses the word `Truck` quite loosely.
    It is used to reference a collection of static and moving loads.
    This table is used to define the axle loads and their spacing.
    It also is used to define the lane load forces.
    This entry in addition to the :ref:`Live Load Definition`
    create a complete set of loadings that can be referenced by one name,
    i.e., the Truck Name.

:ref:`Live Load Envelope Definition`

    BRIDG positions the movable portion of a Truck's loads along a path in
    discrete iterations.  For each iteration, the forces throughout the
    bridge are scanned and a set of envelopes are generated.
    This table is used to define how the moving loads are incrementally positioned.

:ref:`Truck Group Definition`

    This table has a dual purpose. It is used to create a collection of one
    or more trucks that are used in conjunction with the
    :ref:`Lane Group Definition` to specify what trucks to use when generating
    a load combination envelope.
    It also is used to specify the **axle force multiplier** and
    **ultimate load factors** to apply to the truck's loads when used in
    the specified group.

    There is also the Numerator/Denominator switch that tells the program
    whether the loads for this truck in the group will be applied to the
    Numerator or Denominator of the rating equation.
    BRIDG keeps these loads separate for when the rating equation requires
    that not all of the live loads be summed together.

:ref:`Lane Group Definition`

    Except when the special sequenced truck motion method is specified in the
    :ref:`Live Load Envelope Definition` table, the range of positioning
    the truck transverse to the bridge is specified using this table.

:ref:`Lane Load Reduction Definition`

    This table defines the factors that are applied to the truck loads when
    one or more trucks are combined using the :ref:`Truck Group` and :ref:`Lane Group` combination.

:ref:`Rating Factors for LFR` and :ref:`Rating Factors for LRFR`

    This table defines the ultimate dead load factors and the strength reduction factors.

:ref:`Rate Location`

    Except for non-line members, the user needs to specify where the program will
    compute capacities and rate the structure.  Non-line members are always
    analyzed at their critical locations.

:ref:`Load Combination Definition`

    This is where all the entry tables listed above come together to form a bridge
    loading condition.  Only load combinations generate member capacities and
    ratings.

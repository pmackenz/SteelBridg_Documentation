Lane Group Positioning Methods
======================================================

:CTR:  Center Of Bridge Only
:LCR:  Left, Center, and Right of Bridge
:LCRQ: Left, Left Quarter, Center, Right Quarter, Right positions on the bridge.


A `Lane Group` is a set of lanes of
:ref:`3D Live Load Modeling Guidelines for Truss Bridges`:`Lane Width`
placed side by side with no space between.

* No gap between multiple loaded lanes.
* Movement within a lane is not considered, but the
  :ref:`3D Live Load Modeling Guidelines for Truss Bridges`::ref:`Lane Width Definition`
  is positioned within the lane in accordance with the positioning codes: `CTR`, `LCR`, `LCRQ`.
  Please see the graphic below.

If the lane group can not be completely fit between the right and left edges,
then that configuration is **not** processed.
For example, if the lane group centered over the left quarter point causes
the left side of the group to extend beyond the left edge, then that loading
configuration would not be processed.

The placement of the :ref:`3D Live Load Modeling Guidelines for Truss Bridges`::ref:`Lane Width Definition`, `TCW`,
within the lane depends on the placement of the lane group.
If the lane group position is `Left` or `Left Quarter`, then the `TCW` will
be placed against the left edge of the lane boundary.
For `Center` placement, the `TCW` will be centered in the lane.
For `Right` and `Right Quarter` placements, the `TCW` will be placed
against the right edge of the lane boundary.

On narrow bridges it is possible for a truck axle to leave the road surface.
When this happens, the program will issue a warning message.
Typically this will occure when the truck clearance width, and striped
lane width is not reduced in accordance with the specifications defined
in the :ref:`3D Live Load Modeling Guidelines for Truss Bridges`::ref:`Lane Width Definition`
of the :ref:`WSDOT Live Load Criteria` in topic page
:ref:`3D Live Load Modeling Guidelines for Truss Bridges`.
A truck axle leaving the road surface might not be a critical condition,
and it is up to the engineer to determine if adjustments to the truck
parameters is required.

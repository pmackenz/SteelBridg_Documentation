Concrete Slab - Steps for checking composite member generation.
======================================================

#. Select the Viewer window and then select the FEM view.  This will force the system to compute all the composite member data if not done already.<BR></LI>
#. Now return to the Editor view of the member and select the PLOT button.   Then select the Depth Profile view and check that the system shows concrete over the girder.<BR></LI>
#. Also check that you have defines shear connectors because the system will not consider the member composite unless both concrete and shear connectors are present.<BR></LI></P>

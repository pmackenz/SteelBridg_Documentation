Concrete Slab - Steps for checking composite member generation.
------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Select the Viewer window and then select the FEM view.
   This will force the system to compute all the composite member
   data if not done already.
#. Now return to the Editor view of the member and select the `PLOT` button.
   Then select the Depth Profile view and check that the system shows
   concrete over the girder.
#. Also check that you have defines shear connectors because the system will
   not consider the member composite unless both concrete and shear connectors
   are present.

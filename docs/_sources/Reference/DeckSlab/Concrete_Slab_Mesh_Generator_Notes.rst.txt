Concrete Slab Mesh Generator Notes
======================================================

The concrete mesh generator is one of the most complex subsystems in
the entire program.  It is also the most likely process to not work as expected.
This page has some hints and rules to help discover and resolve mesh generation
problems.

After your model is defined, the first thing that should be done is to see
if the deck slab is meshed correctly.  This involves checking that the mesh
plates are positioned where expected and that they all tie into the line
members where appropriate.  After this check is performed and the mesh is
satisfactory, then you will need to check that the composite members have
been created where expected.

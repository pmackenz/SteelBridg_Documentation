Concrete Slab Mesh Generator Notes
======================================================

<P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
<P>The concrete mesh generator is one of the most complex subsystems in the entire program.  It is also the most likely process to not work as expected.  This page has some hints and rules to help discover and resolve mesh generation problems.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</P>
<P>After your model is defined, the first thing that should be done is to see if the deck slab is meshed correctly.  This involves checking that the mesh plates are positioned where expected and that they all tie into the line members where appropriate.  After this check is performed and the mesh is satisfactory, then you will need to check that the composite members have been created where expected. </P>

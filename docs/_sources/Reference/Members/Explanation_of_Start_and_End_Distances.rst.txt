Explanation of Start and End Distances
==========================================

For member shape placement, the start location is the only one required.
Once you specify the location from the start of the member line for a shape to begin,
it will continue until the end of member unless one of the following occur.

1. A Stop distance was entered.
#. Another shape has been specified to start at a distance greater then the current shapes start distance.
#. End of member is reached.

Note that if a member is given a stop distance that is greater then the start distance for another shape, then this stop distance is used for that other shape as well.

A stop, or end, distance is hardly ever needed!  Its primary use is for starting and stopping flange doubler plates that might be discontinuous.
A zero value for **End** distance is considered a "non-entry".

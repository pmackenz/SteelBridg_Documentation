Explanation of Member Weight and Stiffness Codes
===================================================

The program needs to know when to apply member gravity loading and when a member
is active in the analysis.  This is done with the member weight and stiffness codes.

Stiffness Codes:
------------------

1. Only one code can be active in a stage.
#. Enter the stage number that is the first stage for the program to start using 
   the indicated stiffness.  To change the stiffness properties in a subsequent 
   stage, enter that stage number in the appropriate field.
#. Truss Members, Columns, and Misc. Members have their gravity dead load 
   applied in the first stage that they become active.

.. rubric:: MbrStf
..

    The member has only the stiffness of the beam portion of a composite section.

.. rubric:: CompStf
..

    The member has the stiffness of a composite section, where the concrete slab
    portion is calculated using 1n.

.. rubric:: 3nStf
..

    The member has the stiffness of a composite section, where the concrete slab
    portion is calculated using 3n.

.. rubric:: MbrWt
..

    Gravity loads will be calculated for the beam portion of a composite section
    only and applied to the analysis in the indicated stage. Note, the member
    **MUST** be active, i.e., have a stiffness active, in the stage indicated.
    
.. rubric:: SlbWt
..

    Gravity loads will be calculated for the concrete portion of a composite
    section only and applied to the analysis in the indicated stage.
    Note, the member **MUST** be active, i.e. have a stiffness active, in the
    stage indicated.  Slab sub-regions that are not associated with any member
    will have their gravity loads applied in the **CompStf** stage specified
    in the :ref:`Input Concrete Slab Definition` entry.
